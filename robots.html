            <h2>What does it do?</h2>
            <p>A robot Is a machine that you can give anything from simple instructions to far more complex ones
               They are programmable by a computer system and able to function autonomously, by an external device or even via a device embedded within. 
               Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous as stated above this means that robots are currently being used in many different industries.
               anything from industrial bots, medical operating robots, collectively programmed swarm bots or even a ping pong robot!
               Another plus about robots being in the field, is the fact that they make high danger jobs far less hazardous for humans. 
               For e.g. the manufacturing process can cause harm in many ways a task as simple as directing and picking up boxes can over 
               time cause harm in your back. But not a robots in fact very repetitive tasks are where there shine the most they allow for a 
               much higher accuracy/base line level of consistency. Another industry which can save A LOT of people are bomb defusal bots.. 
               I mean do I even have to explain that one. 
               We are in an age where our basic computers can function at a far superior rate than when the first robots where made. 
               Take for example this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQE82derooc">video</a>, now imagine what type of hardware they would have had to work with Building a machine.
               </p>

            <p><br>Now imagine today you could print a part to make something far more functional whilst bringing the cost down and also 
               having a computer system which allows the robot to take input much faster and allow it to make a decision based off of that.
               As time goes on our understanding for coding and developing computer programs grows. 
               The more we learn now the quicker we can grow in the future take for example elon musk and his development of ‘SMART’ cars. 
               If anybody said that to you 10 years ago you would’ve laughed, But today it is visible to you. You can actually see something like that 
               developing in the future maybe not in 3 years time but who know it could be around before we all waste away . 
               What is crazy about this industry is the fact that you now have robots creating robots. Well at the very least speeding up that process. 
               This can in fact lead to further development in the functionality of robotics. In the near future we will most likely have robots running 
               Natural language processing taking our food orders, with another quickly running a mathematical code telling us how long our order 
               will take to get from shop to door. Well that has already started. 
               Robots have the ability to function above and beyond the human ability they could have 13 elbow joints on a single arm with a total 
               rotating wrist and shoulder joint. This can allow a robot to weld something completely without moving or pick and pack orders far 
               quicker than any human could.
               Some may take this as a threat to their future jobs lines but I think this is a far safer option to keep their 
               manual handling risk at an all time low. This will also force some people (like myself) to pursue something far more rewarding, 
               like how to create said robots…

               The future is robots! In one form or another and I hate to say it but they can be everywhere.
               Sadly including sadistic things like war and weaponry. But it is somewhat like a double edge sword 
               cause the mad scientist that could create such an item may just create the next best robot that helps push the software needed for 
               something like a fully automated car or even a robot that can guide the elderly to the shops and bring groceries to and from their doorstep.
               </p>

            <p class="p1"></p>
            <h2>What is the Likely Impact?</h2>
            <p>Lets expand on the loss of jobs, again it is a double edged sword. Robots can be far superior in most industries and long term can 
               be cheaper than humans. upkeep and production cost will become cheaper as technology progresses. 
               The future robots will be able to perform simple task for more accurately and constant then humans. You wont have to worry 
               about paying for workers breaks or stressing over the manual handling risk of a human worker.
               Insurance cost will drop., though with that the power cost and supplier cost will rise what seems to be infinitely. 
               This in my opinion isn’t a completely bad thing. 
               It will force people into learning a specialty of their own improving the general mass of intelligence. 
               Sadly though it will flush out the few who cant afford a working robot and cause many business to fail as robot influence 
               business production speeds will rise. Businesses like Farming, delivery/warehouses and even something  as small 
               as a grocery store will be influenced. Again this could ruin an industry and bring it to its knees. It would be wild if 
               robots begin to autonomously write pieces of complex code to fix a nation wide problem. Again though I think that 
               would also force people to stress about bigger problems like how to incorporate robots/ automated workers in an industry like
               manufacturing and mining. In return bringing the cost of resources down. 
               Making it easier for construction(Prices would change so much over time).

               </p>

            <p class="p2"></p>
            <h2>How will this affect me?</h2>
            <p>Future developments in robots/technology will open up many new pathways for myself since 
               My interest lie in IT and anything related to Gaming/ helper robots.
               I mean for starters my daily life would become a lot more structured and organised imagine a 
               future where you can have a care bot that preps toast for you by the time another wakes you up! It would free 
               up so much time into thinking up the next big idea or even a automated robot that shoots a image (like a projector) 
               around your living space so you can have virtual meetings/chats with family and friends, almost in person when far apart.
               The possibilities to bring us together get me excited (whilst still being able to travel the world). 
               Another huge bonus would be robots taking up a more supportive role in helping the elderly and or sick in regular daily tasks. 
               Anything from grocery shopping to calling a taxi or uber, to something more serious and life saving like calling emergency 
               services or making sure a patient Is safe and possibly in a certain body position to ease 
               their pain, whilst emergency services arrive on site.

               3D printing technology has adapted so much new materials and production equipment have been developed over the past 5-10 years. 
               In the same style of creating the 3D laser cutting machine has so many real world applications just imagine what it could be in another 5-10 years, 
               and imagine robots being able to come in and repair said machine all autonomously!. 
               A world where entire workshops can function on their own and all whilst bringing production levels up. 
               At the beginning it will be expensive as new technology brings draw backs on people not knowing how they function 
               meaning they wont know how to fix it. But over time running these machines wont be so difficult. 
               Technicians will be ready on standby and even further down the line a robot to fix a robot.

               That in itself would force people(like myself) to learn and adapt and in return offer more rewarding and complex jobs. 
               Again making both me and my family that little bit smarter.
