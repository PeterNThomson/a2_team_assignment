            <h2>What does it do?</h2>
            <p class="p1">Autonomous vehicles or more commonly referred to as driver-less 
                cars combine a variety of sensors to perceive their surroundings including, 
                thermographic cameras, radar, lidar and GPS to name a few. This 
                sensory information is then interpreted via advanced control systems 
                to apply navigation paths and identify obstacles and signage. The 
                autonomy of these vehicles is currently categorized into 6 levels 
                developed by <a href="https://www.sae.org/">SAE International</a> (Society 
                of Automotive Engineers), these levels are as follows:</p>
            <img class="levels" src="images/driving_autonomy.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="p2">As of March 2022, the vast majority of autonomous vehicles are 
                at level 2, with a marginal portion beginning to operate at level 3. Some 
                of these car companies include Tesla, Honda and Mercedes-Benz as well 
                as Toyota operating a “potential” level 4 service around the Tokyo 2020 
                Olympic village. I feel it pertinent to outline the difference between 
                “Autonomous and Automated” vehicles as these 2 designations represent 
                quite different levels of technology. Many projects in recent times 
                relating to vehicle automation have been just that, automation not 
                autonomy, which has been heavily reliant on environmental aids like 
                magnetic strips or designated routes. These types of vehicles have 
                largely been used to in industrial applications for example, 
                <a href="https://www.mining-technology.com/comment/australia-autonomous-haul-trucks-use/">
                haul packs</a> operating on mines sites to move material from point to point. 
                While autonomous vehicles employ the use of various sensory information as 
                mentioned above along with the ability to communicate between other 
                vehicles on a network allowing for a self-governing system that can 
                adapt to any given route.</p>
            <p class="p3">It seems to be abundantly clear that “data” is going to be the 
                key to these systems moving into the future, with today's driver-less 
                systems generating 
                <a href="https://www.sisense.com/blog/why-data-will-power-the-self-driving-car-revolution/">
                25GB of data every hour</a>. The more data that can be fed 
                into the AI and analytic capabilities of advanced driver-assistance systems 
                (ADAS), the safer these vehicles will become. That being said, there 
                are many challenges facing autonomy in vehicles over the coming years. 
                The largest of these hurdles will undoubtedly be to operate safely and 
                effectively in complex and unpredictable environments, with the most 
                unpredictable of these variables being humans. For example, US based 
                company Waymo is currently operating city test sites that could see 
                autonomous taxi's in San Francisco and New York as early as 2023, 
                however their co-chief executive Tekadra Mawakana was reluctant to go 
                into further developments as 
                <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22700022/self-driving-autonomous-cars-trolley-problem-waymo-google-tesla">
                “Safety takes time”</a>. One of the key technology advancements that is 
                going to push these vehicles forward is their machine learning improvement 
                and capability, allowing for ADAS systems better learn driver routines and 
                preferences providing a more intuitive driver-less experience.
                For example, if someone was to for instance leave for work around a 
                similar time Monday-Friday, through machine learning the vehicle will 
                be able to recognize this and execute that task automatically. Another 
                key technology factor moving forward is security. 
                <a href="https://www.stealthlabs.com/blog/autonomous-car-security-adversarial-attacks-against-new-mobility/#:~:text=The%20apparent%20risks%2C%20such%20as,drivers%20and%20other%20road%20users.">
                Cybersecurity</a> threats are a very real and ever-present danger in our society, 
                particularly in the automotive sector. As products become more complex, contain 
                exponentially more control systems and code, a greater number of points 
                of weakness arise. Given the speed at which cybersecurity, and the 
                threats associated are evolving, this is likely to be a difficult and 
                ongoing challenge.</p>
            <h2>What is the Likely Impact?</h2>
            <p class="p4">The advent of autonomous vehicles will have an incredible impact 
                across all aspects of the automotive industry and the world as a whole. 
                It stands to reason if driver-less technology (particularly in terms of 
                <a href="https://zedcarz.co.uk/2021/02/28/how-will-driverless-cars-impact-the-taxi-industry/#:~:text=Whilst%20driverless%20vehicles%20could%20be,drivers%20lessens%2C%20this%20could%20change.">
                taxi</a> or shared vehicle ownership) becomes efficient enough, both in terms 
                of cost and ease of access, people may be far more inclined to not even own 
                their own vehicle. With the cost of things like general maintenance and 
                registration, the demand for car production could take quite a hit, costing 
                jobs in both the production and driver service industries. Another element of 
                impact may be 
                <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/columbiabusinessschool/2021/03/25/will-self-driving-cars-disrupt-the-insurance-industry/?sh=5593bbd31dbf">
                automotive insurance</a>, as an industry based largely on risk, 
                removing the human error factor from driving would likely cause insurance 
                premiums to plumet. This of course would not likely occur until the vast 
                majority of vehicles on the road are driver-less.</p>
            <p class="p5">While the industries highlighted above may sustain heavy job losses, 
                the technology industries pertaining to autonomous vehicles, such as machine 
                learning, AI and security to name a few, 
                <a href="https://www.trafficsafetystore.com/blog/driverless-cars-will-create-jobs-in-these-6-industries/">
                will increase</a>. It seems imperative that these industry sectors are addressed 
                and have systems in place for re-training before they collapse.</p>
            <h2>How will this affect me?</h2>
            <p class="p6">From a personal point of view, I have extremely mixed feeling about 
                driver-less technology. As someone who is passionate about technology and being 
                as efficient as possible, the notion of autonomous vehicles fills me an 
                incredible amount of excitement, not to mention the comfort of knowing family 
                and friend would be traveling in a safer format than today. However, I really 
                enjoy driving, the feeling of control and raw power of an engine at your 
                fingertips. I think I selfishly hope that it takes a little longer than 
                outlined before we don't have a steering wheel anymore. My other point of 
                concern is not for me but my younger brother. While only just turned 21 years 
                old, he has displayed incredible drive and discipline (not to mention financial 
                investment) to obtain his road-train license/more machine operator tickets than 
                there are degrees on a thermometer, at such a young age. This is something that 
                I have watched him pursue his entire life, and the thought that his dream is at 
                risk of being absorbed by an autonomous fleet of trucks and machines is something 
                that doesn't sit very well with me.</p>
