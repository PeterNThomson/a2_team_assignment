            <h2>What does it do?</h2>
            <p class="p1"></p>
            <h2>What is the Likely Impact?</h2>
            <p class="p2"></p>
            <h2>How will this affect me?</h2>
            <p> Blockchain and cryptocurrencies won’t have a major affect on my, or my family and friends’ daily lives, as we all currently own and use our smartphones for our banking needs.
                All my banking is done through my mobile phone, I send and receive money through either PayID or Osko, which is sent in minutes, better yet, almost instantaneous. I personally have not stepped into a bank for years, if I had to deposit money into my account, I do this through the ATM. 
                If society became cashless and all through blockchain, the threat of hackers or scammers stealing money through online purchases, or my account would be somewhat eliminated. 
                Having personally had money taken from my account through an Uber data breach, and then waiting on my bank to return the money, the thought of this threat being eliminated is welcomed.
                I have traded in cryptocurrencies in the past, as well as having NFTs for sale on Rarible. If I was to sell one of these NFTs, the payment is then made through a blockchain in the form of Ethereum. 
                Due to the ever-changing value of cryptocurrencies, the thought of potentially losing thousands of dollars would have a negative effect on mine, as well as every person I know, and our daily lives., whereas the prospect of gaining thousands of dollars, would obviously be positive, however, myself and those around me would not like to gamble and take chances on our weekly pay checks.
                Removing the need for the middleman in contracts, such as purchasing a house, is convenient and can potentially save money, however, the middleman is there for a reason. For both the buyer and the seller, neither want to be ripped off or scammed and having lawyers, stockbrokers and accountants involved, this process is fair for all users. 
                While blockchain and crypto both can have positive effects, the risk of losing money trading in crypto can have a negative affect on all parties as it can be extremely volatile at this point in time.</p>
