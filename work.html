            <h2>Cyber Security Analyst</h2> 
            <p>Cybersecurity analysts, or CSAs, are experts ‘tasked with the responsibility of detecting, planning and implementing security measures to protect an organization’s network’ (ECPI, 2022)
               by ‘monitoring computer networks for security issues (Secure Disruptions, Youtube, 2021). A cybersecurity analyst works with clients to protect their ‘network and IT infrastructure’ (Indeed, 2022). 
               Someone working as a CSA would spend most of their time in front of a computer, whether that be in an office or at home. 
               The most challenging aspect of this job is ensuring no network is prone to attack, or, if an attack is already taking place, coming up with a ‘solution to control the damage done’ (ECPI, 2022).
               Once clearing the damage, a CSA must then come up with a better solution to stop attacks happening once again, and prepare for the unknown (Secure Disruptions, Youtube, 2011).
               Without these solutions, ‘organisations are at significant risk of losing information, money, access to necessary files and privacy’ (Indeed, 2022).</p>
