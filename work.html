            <h2>Cyber Security Analyst</h2> 
            <p>Cyber Security analysts, or CSAs, are experts ‘tasked with the responsibility of detecting, planning and implementing security measures to protect an organization’s network’ (ECPI, 2022)
               by ‘monitoring computer networks for security issues (Secure Disruptions, Youtube, 2021). A Cyber Security Analyst works with clients to protect their ‘network and IT infrastructure’ (Indeed, 2022). 
               Someone working as a CSA would spend most of their time in front of a computer, whether that be in an office or at home. 
               The most challenging aspect of this job is ensuring no network is prone to attack, or, if an attack is already taking place, coming up with a ‘solution to control the damage done’ (ECPI, 2022).
               Once clearing the damage, a CSA must then come up with a better solution to stop attacks happening once again, and prepare for the unknown (Secure Disruptions, Youtube, 2011).
               Without these solutions, ‘organisations are at significant risk of losing information, money, access to necessary files and privacy’ (Indeed, 2022).</p>
           
            <h2>Computer Programmer</h2>
            <p> Not only do Computer Programmers write code, but they also have tasks including ‘write and test programs, review and rewrite programs, correct coding errors, and cyber security’ (Amadi Amaewhule, Career Karma, 2022).
                Many Computer Programmers work from home (Hallden, Youtube, 2021), however Computer Programmers can be quite flexible in the aspect of working on the move or even in an office type setting and interacting with clients,
                as well as investors for Apps they are building, even freelancing ideas regarding a potential new video game etc. The most challenging aspect of being a computer programmer is not only learning the code and various languages,
                but ‘analysing and categorizing all potential variables before any code is written’ (Degree Query, 2022).
                As Computer Programmers have multiple different languages, multiple different languages are used to create different types of projects,
                example being HTML and CSS are great for basic application and website development and have more of a beginner skillset, whereas JavaScript can bring more life to a website, making it more interactive.
                Another example would be Go or Golang, this language is a bit more complex and is used for an intermediate programmer with a bit more of an advanced skillset,
                ‘Golang is primarily used in back-end technologies, cloud services, distributed networks, IoT, but it has also been used to create console utilities, GUI applications, and web applications’ (KDnuggets, 2021).
