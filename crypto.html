            <h2>What does it do?</h2>
            <p>Cryptocurrency, also known as crypto, is ‘any form of currency that exists digitally or virtually and uses cryptography to secure transactions’ (Kapersky, 2022).
                The most well-known cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple and these can be used as peer-to-peer transactions, or to purchase tech products through Microsoft,
                watches through Rolex, cars through mass-market brands to high-end luxury dealers, and Insurance through Swiss insurer AXA (Kapersky, 2022). 
                All transactions are safe and difficult for hackers to tamper with, including a two-factor authentication process. 
                This process can include an individual username and password to begin the transaction, as well as an authentication code sent to a personal cell or mobile phone number.
                BitPay, a cryptocurrency debit card is also accepted in the United States, in retailers that do not directly accept cryptocurrency. In the next three years, 
                a reality in all countries could be Bitcoin being a legal tender, as it is in El Salvador, alongside the US Dollar. 
                Allowing Bitcoin to be a legal tender was made in a move ‘hoping to improve citizens’ access to financial services’ (Porter, The Verge, 2021). In Australia,
                the process of becoming a legal tender, alongside the Australian dollar, has already started, with Bitcoin allowing you to purchase NBN, house renovations, solar power, pet food and education,
                as stated by Crypto News Australia and the scale goes on. Bitcoin can also be used in certain restaurants and cafes, pay for tattoos, used to purchase flights and hotels,
                and can even be used to pay for educations, with Flinders University allowing you to do so (Pash, Pedestrian Group,2014). 
                In the future, if cryptocurrencies became legal tenders in Australia, individuals will be able to purchase homes, pay bills, pay for medical appointments, 
                purchase cars, groceries and more. Cryptocurrencies all run on a distributed public ledger, which is called a blockchain.
                <br> <br>
                
                A blockchain is a ‘distributed database that is shared among the nodes of a computer network, storing information electronically in digital form’ (Hayes, Investopedia, 2022),
                which guarantees the security and fidelity of a record of data, generating trust without the need for a third party. 
                Blockchains store data in blocks, that then link together via cryptography. As the new data arrives, it is entered into a new block, which, once filled with the data, 
                it chains onto the previous block, ensuring the data is chained in chronological order. 
                Different types of data and information can be stored on a blockchain, but the most common to date is a ledger for transactions. 
                When purchasing food and coffee in certain restaurants, tattoos through certain studios, or education with Flinders University using Bitcoin, once the networks confirm there is enough Bitcoins available,
                the transaction is complete and added to the Bitcoin blockchain, or ledger, that only consist of Bitcoin transactions. 
                The mission of blockchain, which was first proposed as a research project in 1991, is to allow ‘digital information to be recorded and distributed, but not edited’
                (Hayes, Investopedia, 2022). Therefore, a blockchain is the foundation for immutable ledges, or records that cannot be deleted, altered, or destroyed. 
                In the next three years, blockchain can be used for medical records, land or home sales, car sales and instant money transfers, 
                while ensure all trust and security is maintained between two parties. In 2009, Bitcoin became the first widespread application in use for a blockchain concept,
                with other various cryptocurrencies, NFTS, decentralized finance applications and smart contracts following suit. According to Richard Jett for Do Cryptocurrency online, 
                Blockchain technology has the potential to completely transform business, government and society as much, or perhaps even more than, the internet has (Jett, Docryptocurrency, 2018). 

            <p class="p1"></p>
            <h2>What is the Likely Impact?</h2>
            <p>
                Blockchain could transform the world. Replacing the need for stockbrokers, lawyers and accountants when purchasing houses, removing the need to pay a large fee for a middleman,
                with the contract and transactions recorded permanently, without being altered. When deciding to purchase a house, there will be no need to pay a large fee to a middleman.
                Everyone who has a smartphone will be affected, owning their own data, such as public health records, as well as having the option to receive money in minutes. In the future, Blockchain will allow users to 'scan food items at a grocery store, 
                such as an apple with a bar code sticker, and instantly see the entire history of the apple' (Jett, Docryptocurrency, 2018). 
                With blockchain, companies, such as the Equifax would no longer 'have any reason to exist' (Jett, Docryptocurrency, 2018), due to blockchain being secure and having no concerns about major data hacks. 
                With the option of moving money directly from one person to another anywhere in the world quickly and securely using a cryptocurrency. 
                Blockchain and cryptocurrencies can make the world a cashless society, removing the need for ATMs and bank tellers, with the world using blockchain and cryptocurrencies for all payments, transfers, purchases and sales. 
                Blockchain can also provide a '99% reduction in the amount of government corruption' (Jett, Docryptocurrency, 2018), as all transactions are public and cannot be altered.
                While Jett's article was from 2018, blockchain is currently being used for smart contracts and decentralized finance. 
                'Smart contracts constitute a programmatic agreement between two parties' (Nibley, Sofi, 2021) with insurance companies, healthcare companies and governments looking at using Blockchain.
                DeFi allows users to source coding to 'facilitate traditional financial services in ways that do not require a bank' (Nibley, Sofi, 2021), with peer-to-peer lending. 
                Instead of getting loans from a bank, DeFi allows people to make loans to one another with crypto, the terms of the loan written in smart contracts.

            <h2>How will this affect me?</h2>
            <p> Blockchain and cryptocurrencies won't have a major affect on my, or my family and friends' daily lives, as we all currently own and use our smartphones for our banking needs.
                All my banking is done through my mobile phone, I send and receive money through either PayID or Osko, which is sent in minutes, better yet, almost instantaneous. I personally have not stepped into a bank for years,
                if I had to deposit money into my account, I do this through the ATM. 
                If society became cashless and all through blockchain, the threat of hackers or scammers stealing money through online purchases, or my account would be somewhat eliminated. 
                Having personally had money taken from my account through an Uber data breach, and then waiting on my bank to return the money, the thought of this threat being eliminated is welcomed.
                I have traded in cryptocurrencies in the past, as well as having NFTs for sale on Rarible. If I was to sell one of these NFTs, the payment is then made through a blockchain in the form of Ethereum. 
                Due to the ever-changing value of cryptocurrencies, the thought of potentially losing thousands of dollars would have a negative effect on mine, as well as every person I know, and our daily lives.,
                whereas the prospect of gaining thousands of dollars, would obviously be positive, however, myself and those around me would not like to gamble and take chances on our weekly pay checks.
                Removing the need for the middleman in contracts, such as purchasing a house, is convenient and can potentially save money, however, the middleman is there for a reason. For both the buyer and the seller,
                neither want to be ripped off or scammed and having lawyers, stockbrokers and accountants involved, this process is fair for all users. 
                While blockchain and crypto both can have positive effects, the risk of losing money trading in crypto can have a negative affect on all parties as it can be extremely volatile at this point in time.</p>
