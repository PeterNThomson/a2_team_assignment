            <h2>What does it do?</h2>
            <p class="p1">One the high end of clouds or cloud computing and it's services is google 
                in how the spread of the field and service it extends  because  of the advancing ways 
                for new opportunities and to expand businesses forward, even for beginning businesses 
                cause of the use of wireless connection to use it makes this a cost effective and it's 
                coinvent to access their services that allows to share documents and work on team 
                projects on programs  such as google docs, google slide, google sheet which this allows 
                the user to change and suggest comments to work that could be in need of it and saves 
                changes to the document so if a users computer were to die or closes it the file. 
                This could allow the user to access to unlimited storage on one drive or document 
                which could be a arranged to how the user wants. Which this makes it so that they 
                can protect your important files and so instead of having a houses the attachments to 
                your server or any other device for data storage such as a Diskstation, HDD or an SSD 
                for your device, you could upload it to external storage provide (VSA) which is from 
                canvas video on cloud computing that's Virtualization As Fast As Possible (April 6, 2022) 
                so you don't have to employing more people to do it. it could be used to have meetings 
                and connect with people through another application that it provides google meets that 
                could record, has a chat thread where you could ask question or discussion. This is 
                carried out with the use of virtualization which is the abstraction of the OS of the 
                hardware that is the server or the server that is used for the cloud or this is called 
                the virtual host that allows it to be shared and used with other user which this is the 
                virtual layer. Hypervisors is what makes the virtual layer through making multiple OS from 
                the virtual host which this is called Virtual Machines that could be sold, used, shared, 
                stored on a client device through the Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) which these could be 
                seen in a form of a infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and a platform as a service (PaaS), 
                software as a service (SaaS) which this would apply to google cloud platform (GCP) and 
                google workplace (formerly G suit) as a IaaS, SaaS. This is cause of the flexibility and 
                accessibility of wireless connection which makes it more usable to access these services 
                cause cloud computing is a part of the network. Which with the recent improvements 
                in wifi  and nbn which has occurred in the past 3 to 6 years from 4G to 5G meaning that 
                the demand for more development of connection speeds for processing or transferring of 
                data from Microsoft cloud sever and update their storage compacity as more businesses are 
                becoming dependant on their services which they depicting themselves as an enterprise 
                resource planning service (ERP) that's an enterprise friendly from the CRN (April 6, 2022) 
                and businesses become more digital. The events that have to occur for this to happen is 
                that businesses would find it more accessible and of a benefit to move to become more 
                digital in how it operates which are that the application that google workplace (formerly 
                G suit) has to use and the google cloud platform (GCP) that save the changes on the file 
                that your using is more cost effective then have a storage room or a place to have storage 
                for server storage in and to have more IT technician to manage those server storages </p>
            <h2>What is the Likely Impact?</h2>
            <p class="p2">With the recent development of these services taking a hold of trends of 
                businesses that are leading onto being dependent on using the connivences that the 
                services that google cloud platform (GCP) and google workplace (formerly G suit) 
                applications provide making it the new standard for businesses to use. this means that 
                businesses would be going to a more virtual business model in how they could not accommodate 
                for physical server data storage room or could have not a lot of physical server data storage 
                because of the is googles VSA which is google drive and this can allow you to share files 
                with other users. The rise of the new branch that google has gone into which is the 
                enterprise friendly market with Microsofts window where it has word, power point, excel 
                which are already uploaded onto the device that has always been the main application on 
                these devices  which has an productivity of users have been using the services that is 
                87.5%, the amount that is taken by users that use google workplace (formerly G suit) is 
                10.4% in 2018 (April 7, 2022) which are attempting to convert the user that uses Office 
                suite and Office 365. Microsoft windows have now made a cloud server called one drive to 
                the Office 365 various other applications such as Microsoft teams. This will result in 
                making the IT Technician reduce or if not a bit In being employed to businesses because 
                there's no need to employ people to manage and to look over maintaining servers and do 
                security checks, make sure that there's space for the hardware of the server storage and 
                see if the rooms protected or not. The dived in the amount of user will increase more 
                whether their use google workplace (formerly G suit) or Office suite and Office 365 for 
                projects this would result in the one of them being left unused or reduced in the amount 
                user.</p>
            <h2>How will this affect me?</h2>
            <p class="p3">This will affect not that much in their attempt to have an edge over Microsoft 
                or google in a struggle for their domains through google implementing the applications of 
                the google workplace (formerly G suit) such as google doc, google slide and how Microsoft 
                had put in a cloud VSA into their Office suite to attract one anothers users in how whether 
                to use google workplace (formerly G suit) or Microsoft Office 365 to do a project and files 
                which I can choose either one to use or work on an application that the group that I'm 
                working with are using for assignments, this doesn't really affect me that much in my 
                daily life cause I'm the person that they are providing there services to meaning that I 
                can pick what application to use and can follow trends that are suggesting what service 
                to use and see what one fits my needs. This is because if we were to look at this from a 
                business stand point I'm a consumer of the services that they provide which means that 
                depending on what the  people that google and Microsoft are catering to feel as what they 
                are providing is not the user needs they will go to another business that does and result 
                in a divide the market share of the businesses and they would have to improve the product 
                or service that would be by changing the service according to the market to get some of 
                their user back. I feel as this won't have that much of an affect on my family and friends 
                because they would fit in the similar position as me being the consumer although with the 
                new developments that Microsoft and google have update to these applications have to do 
                updates on my dads computer.</p>
