            <p>Michael <br> For me, The highlight of assessment 2 was the amazing
                team of like-minded individuals i got to work with, and get to continue
                my IT studies with, as there is a very happy and friendly flow we have going on,
                not to mention the key aspects in which we are all persuing a passion!
                We are all so passionate about what we are doing which makes for
                an easy flowing work environment, also a fun one. Many laughs were shared
                as well as alot of help amongst one another, and personally i would not of,
                or could not of, been gifted with better team mates. In regard to where we could
                potentially improve, Personally i think Microsoft Teams would be a good starting point.
                We had many great meetings however they were not essentially very "clear" in the sense
                of meeting agendas etc. Moving forward, Personally I believe this is an area we could
                and should work on. Currently working at a Pet resort as an animal attendant, Mind you
                I did quit my job to persue my IT journey however was drafted back into slight employment
                as we had a few staff members leave. Going forward i wish to put my %110 percent into this,
                As aposed to just 100%. You have not seen the last of us yet! "The Procrastinator's" will keep
                shining on! </p>
                
                
                
            
            <p>Peter <br> The highlight of this assignment for me was meeting a 
                group of awesome, like-minded guys who are as passionate as I am 
                for the IT industry. An improvement moving forward with the rest 
                of the course, in my eyes, would be our usage of Microsoft Teams. 
                I feel like portions of our meetings weren't really achieving a 
                whole lot and I think going into future meetings having a more 
                clearly defined agenda, and better recording of actions discussed 
                would help us keep the meetings to a more reasonable time limit as 
                a couple of them were a little drawn out. While I wouldn't say 
                that it was necessarily surprising, but more just interesting, 
                was hearing/reading about the groups different backgrounds and 
                what drove them to seek a career in the IT industry, particularly 
                given that we all had fairly similar job title goals in mind, yet 
                for vastly different companies. As someone who has been working in 
                a quite specific type of team environment for the better part of 15 
                years as a chef, something that become clear to me through this 
                assignment was the difference in pacing. Working in a more relaxed 
                and thought driven scenario was a welcome change to the rush and 
                volume of a kitchen.</p>
