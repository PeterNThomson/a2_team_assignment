            <h2>What does it do?</h2>
            <p class="p1">One the high end of clouds or cloud computing and it’s services is google in how the spread of the field and service it extends  because  of the advancing ways for new opportunities and to expand businesses forward, even for beginning businesses cause of the use of wireless connection to use it makes this a cost effective and it’s coinvent to access their services that allows to share documents and work on team projects on programs  such as google docs, google slide, google sheet which this allows the user to change and suggest comments to work that could be in need of it and saves changes to the document so if a users computer were to die or closes it the file. This could allow the user to access to unlimited storage on one drive or document which could be a arranged to how the user wants. Which this makes it so that they can protect your important files and so instead of having a houses the attachments to your server or any other device for data storage such as a Diskstation, HDD or an SSD for your device, you could upload it to external storage provide (VSA) which is from canvas video on cloud computing that’s Virtualization As Fast As Possible (April 6, 2022) so you don’t have to employing more people to do it. it could be used to have meetings and connect with people through another application that it provides google meets that could record, has a chat thread where you could ask question or discussion. This is carried out with the use of virtualization which is the abstraction of the OS of the hardware that is the server or the server that is used for the cloud or this is called the virtual host that allows it to be shared and used with other user which this is the virtual layer. Hypervisors is what makes the virtual layer through making multiple OS from the virtual host which this is called Virtual Machines that could be sold, used, shared, stored on a client device through the Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) which these could be seen in a form of a infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and a platform as a service (PaaS), software as a service (SaaS) which this would apply to google cloud platform (GCP) and google workplace (formerly G suit) as a IaaS, SaaS. This is cause of the flexibility and accessibility of wireless connection which makes it more usable to access these services cause cloud computing is a part of the network.      Which with the  recent improvements in wifi  and nbn which has occurred in the past 3 to 6 years from 4G to 5G meaning that the demand for more development of connection speeds for processing or transferring of data from Microsoft cloud sever and update their storage compacity as more businesses are becoming dependant on their services which they depicting themselves as an enterprise resource planning service (ERP) that’s an enterprise friendly from the CRN (April 6, 2022) and businesses become more digital. The events that have to occur for this to happen is that businesses would find it more accessible and of a benefit to move to become more digital in how it operates which are that the application that google workplace (formerly G suit) has to use and the google cloud platform (GCP) that save the changes on the file that your using is more cost effective then have a storage room or a place to have storage for server storage in and to have more IT technician to manage those server storages </p>
