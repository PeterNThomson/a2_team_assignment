            <h2>Skills Summary</h2>
            <p>In terms of IT specific skills, disregarding a degree and industry 
                experience which are considered as desirable across almost all IT 
                jobs. Some of these skills required such as LabView Programming 
                and TypeScript is considered more niche, not making an appearance 
                on the top skills list at all. Windows, networking, object-oriented 
                programming skills, cloud-based abilities and the C family of coding 
                languages on the other hand are quite high on this list. <br>
                It is unsurprising that communication skills are (by an incredible 
                margin) at the top of the list in terms of general skills, along with 
                all non-IT specific skills making an appearance on the list in some 
                way, shape or form.
                </p>
            <p><br>Three IT related skills that are in demand but not present, or at least 
                not specifically outlined under our various desired job listings are 
                SQL, Java and JavaScript.<br>
                When looking at non-IT related skills, we would be hesitant to list 
                anything here as every single skill on this list, from communication 
                skills, all the way down to decision making (which is at the bottom of 
                the list compared to communication being at the top) are, in our minds, 
                all essential skills. It wouldn't really be feasible for a company to 
                list all of these non-essential skills on every job listing, and sure 
                there is bound to be outlying examples where you may not be required for
                 example, to have amazing presentation skills. But in general, it is our 
                 belief that all non-essential IT skills would be highly sort after in 
                 any industry, not just IT.

                <h2>Personal Opinions</h2>
                <p>Peter <br> As my dream to work for a company like SpaceX has absolutely nothing 
                    to do with what the industry perceives as a high demand job title, 
                    my goals haven't changed one bit. My goals have nothing to do with 
                    how much money I can make, which country the job is located or how 
                    much competition there is around a job, and everything to do with 
                    passion, I have an unwavering interest in both space and technology. 
                    There are no illusions about timeframe here, this is likely not a 
                    job that will be attainable even inside this decade, with a 
                    potentiality of falling short of SpaceX all together. However, as I 
                    have said before, this is my dream. If you have a dream, and you want 
                    it bad enough, GET AFTER IT.</p>
