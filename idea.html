                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>After going over the various ideas proposed by the team with practicality and achievability in mind, we ended up settling on Alexander’s Spotify overlay.
                This idea received high praise from Thomas Bierly in the feedback from A1 and ended up winning us over with its simplicity and potential; it is highly feasible, and it reaches an already large and established market, the music industry, while additionally planting the seeds for a future submarket of simplistic, quality-of-life applications that add up to make a difference.
                <br><br>
                In essence, we think the overlay represents a fantastic opportunity for us to learn and produce a quality product that offers untapped value to users.
                </p>

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>We want to create the ultimate lightweight overlay for playing music on Spotify. The overlay will be bound to a hotkey that will bring up an informative minimalist window in the upper left corner of your screen. This window will have intuitive button-based controls that allow for rapid song selection and effortless volume adjustment, among other things—all without causing any disruption to your current focus.
                </p>

                <h2>Motivation</h2>
                <p>Music is one of the common pleasures we all share, one way or another; almost everyone listens to music in some form.
                    Today, Spotify alone has 406 million users, with over 25% of Americans reporting that they use Spotify monthly.
                    That’s a lot of songs being skipped, and yet we can’t help feeling like the action is clunky and distracting. If I want more choice over what track to play next, I have to stop what I’m doing, open the application, and sift through my unorganised playlists until I find something that tickles my fancy.
                    What if I had a convenient overlay that knew what I wanted to play ahead of time, didn’t involve alt-tabbing and gave me more control than the original service, all without breaking focus on my workflow or gameplay.
                    <br>That’s what we want to achieve.
                    </p>

                <h2>Why is this important?</h2>
                <p>The time that it takes to alt-tab and find something to listen to, or even simply adjust the volume of your song might seem insignificant, but whether you’re an artist immersed in a project or a gamer min-maxing every decision, you’d be surprised how much a simple alt-tab can shift your focus, not to mention the time it takes to alt-tab, especially in some fullscreen applications, definitely adds up.
                    I have experienced first-hand the kind of difference a simple quality of life change like this can make. For example, in Adobe After Effects, I often work with dozens of effects at once, which involves opening a nested dropdown menu or selecting the painfully slow search window to find the effect I’m looking for, which works fine. Still, when I tried the FX Console plugin by VideoCopilot, my workflow suddenly felt more focused, streamlined, and much quicker. I couldn’t go back to the built-in methods. FX Console achieved this by adding a simple hotkey that opened a more optimised search overlay that I could immediately type into without using any mouse input.
                    </p>

                <p>In reality, the time saved is minimal, but the perceived difference is much more valuable because I’m not losing my train of thought and, in turn, getting more work done. In this case, the seamless overlay makes all the difference.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Acknowledgement</h2>
                <p>Before we get more in-depth, we want to acknowledge that Spotify does currently have a built-in overlay integrated with the windows media keys, but this overlay offers no real convenience over alt-tabbing, and its intrusive implementation is more frustrating than anything, which is partly what inspired us to make this tool.
                    We also want to clarify that Spotify has built-in keybinds, but they’re only useable with the application in focus; in addition to that, they’re a burden to press and unchangeable.
                    </p>

                <h2>Overlay Features</h2>
                <p><u1>
                    <li>Instantly pause and play your music with keybinds.</li>
                    <li>Rapidly cycle back and forth through your songs assisted by a visual queue.</li>
                    <li>Quick and precise volume adjustment using the scroll wheel.</li>
                    <li>Skip through your track with an inbuilt scrubber.</li>
                    <li>Select new music through your playlists or recommended songs.</li>
                    <li>Clearly displayed track information, e.g. Song title, artist name, album.</li>
                </u1></p>
                <p>While it’s tempting to include extra functionality, keeping the program light and not cluttering the overlay is essential.</p>

                <h2>What comes next?</h2>
                <p>In future versions, we want to implement basic customisation options such as custom layouts, colour themes and toggling GUI elements.
                    Outside of that, other features would only serve to clutter and bloat the program, going against our design philosophy.
                    The only exception to this might be implementing support for other music streaming services and eventually local directories, for audiophiles and their FLAC collections.
                    </p>

                <h2>Visual Presentation</h2>
                <p>The core visual elements of the overlay start with a primary set of three cards; the middle card represents the current song, with the other two representing the previous and following songs. There is a vertical volume bar to the left, and beneath these elements is the playback/scrubber bar and recommended similar songs. The overlay will clearly display all information such as the song and artist name, focusing on avoiding clutter.</p>

                <h2>Controls</h2>
                <p>What takes this GUI to the next level are the intuitive and responsive controls, all of which will be customisable.
                    By default, the overlay is hidden and will only display as long as the keybind is held; this keybind is “alt” by default, which is easy to press during other activities and feels familiar due to its association with bringing up other windows.
                    The following table demonstrates the default key binds and their actions while alt is held.</p>
                    
                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Keybind</th>
                            <th>Action</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Mouse Wheel Up</th>
                            <th>Raise Volume</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Mouse Wheel Down</th>
                            <th>Lower Volume</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Shift</th>
                            <th>Pause; Play</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Q</th>
                            <th>Previous Track</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <th>E</th>
                            <th>Next Track</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Control</th>
                            <th>Random Track</th>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
                <p>The menu may also be navigated exclusively with a mouse.</p>

                <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
                <p>The program will be built for Windows in Python and utilise the Tekore library to take advantage of Spotify’s Web API.
                    We plan to use Tekore over the more common Spotipy library for general ease of use and simplicity, but this could change.
                    The code will be split into two modules, a frontend for handling inputs and all of the visual elements displayed on the user’s end, and a backend for handling requests to the API wrapper and handling exceptions.
                    </p>

                <h2>Skills Required</h2>
                <p>Once we start working on the project, the required skills may change or evolve. The current expected skills needed to complete this project are as follows:
                    <u1>
                        <li>Knowledge of the Tekore library for integration with Spotify.</li>
                        <li>Knowledge of the pygame library for creating the overlay window itself.</li>
                        <li>Knowledge of the tkinter library for creating the overlay’s GUI.</li>
                        <li>Basic knowledge of the pywin32 library for changing focus within Windows.</li>
                        <li>A basic understanding of Python’s syntax.</li>
                    </u1>
                </p>

                <h2>Outcome</h2>
                <p>If the development of this program is successful, we will have created a streamlined solution to alt-tabbing that encourages focus, productivity, and at the very least, a more eye-pleasing alternative to the windows media overlay.
                    My friends and I will get the Spotify overlay we always wanted, and hopefully, you will too.
