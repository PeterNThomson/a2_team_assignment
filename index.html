                   My name is Michael Ridgway, I originate from New South Wales however now live
                   on the beautiful Gold Coast, Queensland. I currently work as an Animal Attendant
                   at a boarding kennel. My interest in IT started at the age of seven, compelled to learn all of
                   the secrets and exploit bugs within a computer game, as well as play them for what they are
                   on my parents good old Windows 94 computer with dial up Internet. Growing up, 
                   if I wasn't gaming, I was trying to fix all of the viruses and errors
                   installed through my Limewire usage. Before starting this course,
                   my knowledge in IT was self taught through gaming, Youtube, and general trial and errors.
                   I am currently 28 years of age and cannot wait to see where this ever so expanding journey
                   of IT takes me as it is a true passion of mine.</p>

                    My name is Peter Thomson, I was born and 
                    raised in Western Australia attending school in the city before 
                    moving outwards to the country. Up until this point in my life I 
                    have worked predominantly as a chef, with some positions allowing 
                    me to work and see some extremely remote and amazing areas of this 
                    country. My interest in IT mainly stems from a love of computer 
                    games with my experience generally centred around the same topic, 
                    general troubleshooting and the like when games or the pc in 
                    general spits out one of those wonderful errors they like to give 
                    from time to time. 
                <p>The results of these tests didn't really return anything too 
                    surprising. I have always been quite a solitary person, particularly 
                    with my time outside of work. However, when forming and operating 
                    within a team environment I have always enjoyed working alongside 
                    people with a variety of viewpoints and opinions, I feel that 
                    exposing yourself to people with ideas that conflict your own help 
                    you grow as person. I like to think I'm a pretty down to earth and 
                    easy-going kind of a guy which is something that has seen me do very 
                    well is group settings. This along with being fairly good at reading 
                    people, and my attention detail plus willingness to learn give me 
                    the ability to be an engaging and compassionate team member.</p>

                    My name is Alexander Sloan; I live in a small country town in Victoria, 
                    Australia, where I work as a freelance video editor. <br>
                    Since the age of about five, I was glued to computer screens. Captured by 
                    this new avenue of creation, I began playing with 3D modelling using SketchUp 
                    and recording home videos on Photo Booth. <br>
                    At age 11, I found my first true passion-video editing. I would spend the next 
                    eight years teaching myself the ins and outs of video production and filmmaking,
                    at some points working professionally, but mainly just as a hobby for my enjoyment. <br>
                    Today, I am 19 years old, and I believe I have found my second true passion-programming, 
                    and I can't wait to see where it takes me.
