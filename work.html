            <h2>Cyber Security Analyst</h2> 
            <p>Cyber Security analysts, or CSAs, are experts 'tasked with the responsibility of detecting, planning and implementing security measures to protect an organization's network' (ECPI, 2022)
               by 'monitoring computer networks for security issues (Secure Disruptions, Youtube, 2021). A Cyber Security Analyst works with clients to protect their 'network and IT infrastructure' (Indeed, 2022). 
               Someone working as a CSA would spend most of their time in front of a computer, whether that be in an office or at home. 
               The most challenging aspect of this job is ensuring no network is prone to attack, or, if an attack is already taking place, coming up with a 'solution to control the damage done' (ECPI, 2022).
               Once clearing the damage, a CSA must then come up with a better solution to stop attacks happening once again, and prepare for the unknown (Secure Disruptions, Youtube, 2011).
               Without these solutions, 'organisations are at significant risk of losing information, money, access to necessary files and privacy' (Indeed, 2022).</p>
           
            <h2>Computer Programmer</h2>
            <p> Not only do Computer Programmers write code, but they also have tasks including 'write and test programs, review and rewrite programs, correct coding errors, and cyber security' (Amadi Amaewhule, Career Karma, 2022).
                Many Computer Programmers work from home (Hallden, Youtube, 2021), however Computer Programmers can be quite flexible in the aspect of working on the move or even in an office type setting and interacting with clients,
                as well as investors for Apps they are building, even freelancing ideas regarding a potential new video game etc. The most challenging aspect of being a computer programmer is not only learning the code and various languages,
                but 'analysing and categorizing all potential variables before any code is written' (Degree Query, 2022).
                As Computer Programmers have multiple different languages, multiple different languages are used to create different types of projects,
                example being HTML and CSS are great for basic application and website development and have more of a beginner skillset, whereas JavaScript can bring more life to a website, making it more interactive.
                Another example would be Go or Golang, this language is a bit more complex and is used for an intermediate programmer with a bit more of an advanced skillset,
                'Golang is primarily used in back-end technologies, cloud services, distributed networks, IoT, but it has also been used to create console utilities, GUI applications, and web applications' (Costa, KDnuggets, 2022).

            <h2>Video Game Designer</h2>
            <p>'Video Game Designers design core features of video games' (Owlguru, 2022), including innovative game and role-play mechanics, story lines and character biographies. 
                This professional also includes providing feedback to designers and other colleagues and devising missions for in game play. 
                A Video Game Designer interacts with their colleagues, 'talking to other teams and other disciplines, communicating ideas and intentions' (Wooga, Youtube, 2020), 
                as well as 'consulting with multiple stakeholders to define requirements and implement online features' (Owlguru, 2022). 
                This professional spends most of their time working in an office setting, with '90% of video game designers having group discussions daily, with 76% finding working in a team is very important' (Owlguru, 2022).
                The most challenging aspect of being a Video Game Designer, is every part of it. Challenges faced are 'making games look and sound good, storytelling, movement and interaction with objects, menus, save systems, multiplayer' (Valentine, IGN, 2022). 
                Video Game Designers also interact with the general public, receiving angry player feedback on the games. Feedback from the general public regarding the launch of a video game can drastically improve gameplay, and is also extremley crucial.
                Especially during the Beta period of a new Video Game, as exploits and bugs can be found, therefore creating the opportunity for the Video Game Designer to troubleshoot or fix general problems. 
            </p>   
              
            <h2>IT Technicians/Professionals</h2>
            <p>IT teams 'handle the configuration, setup, and maintenance of technology hardware, software and connections' (Teksetra, 2021).
               IT Technicians or IT Professionals are also tasked with various other components such as Installing and configuring hardware and software components to ensure functionality,
               Ensuring that all electrical and safety standards are met, as well as troubleshoot software issues.
               IT professionals can work with clients, as well as colleagues, in an IT Technician role by
               'investigating dead laptops and setting up spares, checking internet connection and replacing cables, clearing paper jams, and server maintenance updates' (Swiftsystems, 2022). 
               If the IT technician is hired by a company, most of their time is spent fixing software/computer issues in an office setting.
               Teksetra states the low points, or most challenging aspects, of their position is the 'long hours, constant need to keep learning, dealing with angry customers or employees, and deadline-driven work' (Teksetra, 2022). 
            </p>  
                
            <h2>Web Developer</h2>
            <p>Web Developers spend 'most of their day coding of debugging a site' (Leigh, 2022), with their primary goal to 'create functional, user-friendly websites' (Leigh,2022).
               Web Developers interact with clients, if they are freelance working either from home or in their own office, or if they are employed, they 'typically work on a team,
               regularly interacting with other developers, web designers, IT professionals, and management' (Leigh, 2022), spending their time in an office setting. In a Youtube Q & A, Chris Sean was asked 'How often do you get stuck on a problem?'.
               Sean stated, 'my boss has been assigning me to do things I have never done before, what has made it difficult is that has forced me to learn code base that much more' (Sean, Youtube, 2019). 
               Due to his boss constantly assigning these bug fixes to him, Sean was able to improve. Generally with coding as there are so many languages and constant bugs, physical work and trial and error
               When first learning code can be beneficial as it such a vast experience. When Sean first started, he quit after two months in.
               Coding is the most challenging aspect for a Web Developer as it can be extremely complex when first starting off, even for the advanced IT professional in the best of times.
