            <p>My name is Peter Thomson (student number: s3950560), I was born and 
                raised in Western Australia attending school in the city before 
                moving outwards to the country. Up until this point in my life I 
                have worked predominantly as a chef, with some positions allowing 
                me to work and see some extremely remote and amazing areas of this 
                country. My interest in IT mainly stems from a love of computer 
                games with my experience generally centred around the same topic, 
                general troubleshooting and the like when games or the pc in 
                general spits out one of those wonderful errors they like to give 
                from time to time.</p>
            <p>The results of these tests didn't really return anything too 
                surprising. I have always been quite a solitary person, particularly 
                with my time outside of work. However, when forming and operating 
                within a team environment I have always enjoyed working alongside 
                people with a variety of viewpoints and opinions, I feel that 
                exposing yourself to people with ideas that conflict your own help 
                you grow as person. I like to think I'm a pretty down to earth and 
                easy-going kind of a guy which is something that has seen me do very 
                well is group settings. This along with being fairly good at reading 
                people, and my attention detail plus willingness to learn give me 
                the ability to be an engaging and compassionate team member.</p>

                My name is Alexander Sloan; I live in a small country town in Victoria, 
                Australia, where I work as a freelance video editor. <br>
                Since the age of about five, I was glued to computer screens. Captured by 
                this new avenue of creation, I began playing with 3D modelling using SketchUp 
                and recording home videos on Photo Booth. <br>
                At age 11, I found my first true passion–video editing. I would spend the next 
                eight years teaching myself the ins and outs of video production and filmmaking,
                at some points working professionally, but mainly just as a hobby for my enjoyment. <br>
                Today, I am 19 years old, and I believe I have found my second true passion–programming, 
                and I can’t wait to see where it takes me.
