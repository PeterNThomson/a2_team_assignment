                   My name is Michael Ridgway, I originate from New South Wales however now live
                   on the beautiful Gold Coast, Queensland. I currently work as an Animal Attendant
                   at a boarding kennel. My interest in IT started at the age of seven, compelled to learn all of
                   the secrets and exploit bugs within a computer game, as well as play them for what they are
                   on my parents good old Windows 94 computer with dial up Internet. Growing up, 
                   if I wasn't gaming, I was trying to fix all of the viruses and errors
                   installed through my Limewire usage. Before starting this course,
                   my knowledge in IT was self taught through gaming, Youtube, and general trial and errors.
                   I am currently 28 years of age and cannot wait to see where this ever so expanding journey
                   of IT takes me as it is a true passion of mine.
                </p>
                
                <p>As for my personal test results, they seem to coincide perfectly with my personality and learning style.
                   In a team environment, having a "debater" type personality, I find beneficial as getting to the core of a problem
                   can result in a diagnosis much easier. Also being an "analytical" person and an "extravert"
                   as shown in the Myers-Briggs results and the Big 5 Personality Test, I seem to feel the need to find the
                   core of the problem and get to the solution thoroughly.

                    My name is Peter Thomson, I was born and 
                    raised in Western Australia attending school in the city before 
                    moving outwards to the country. Up until this point in my life I 
                    have worked predominantly as a chef, with some positions allowing 
                    me to work and see some extremely remote and amazing areas of this 
                    country. My interest in IT mainly stems from a love of computer 
                    games with my experience generally centred around the same topic, 
                    general troubleshooting and the like when games or the pc in 
                    general spits out one of those wonderful errors they like to give 
                    from time to time. 
                <p>The results of these tests didn't really return anything too 
                    surprising. I have always been quite a solitary person, particularly 
                    with my time outside of work. However, when forming and operating 
                    within a team environment I have always enjoyed working alongside 
                    people with a variety of viewpoints and opinions, I feel that 
                    exposing yourself to people with ideas that conflict your own help 
                    you grow as person. I like to think I'm a pretty down to earth and 
                    easy-going kind of a guy which is something that has seen me do very 
                    well is group settings. This along with being fairly good at reading 
                    people, and my attention detail plus willingness to learn give me 
                    the ability to be an engaging and compassionate team member.</p>

                    My name is Alexander Sloan; I live in a small country town in Victoria, 
                    Australia, where I work as a freelance video editor. <br>
                    Since the age of about five, I was glued to computer screens. Captured by 
                    this new avenue of creation, I began playing with 3D modelling using SketchUp 
                    and recording home videos on Photo Booth. <br>
                    At age 11, I found my first true passion-video editing. I would spend the next 
                    eight years teaching myself the ins and outs of video production and filmmaking,
                    at some points working professionally, but mainly just as a hobby for my enjoyment. <br>
                    Today, I am 19 years old, and I believe I have found my second true passion-programming, 
                    and I can't wait to see where it takes me.

                    My name is Alexios Angelopoulos although people call me Alex, apparently my student ID is s3951526 and student email is s3951526@student.rmit.edu.au. I was in a wheelchair since I was five years old with dystonia which is essentially makes it difficult to move that’s effected the right side of my body,I’m Greek and Italian, although being born in Australia, i celebrate two easters.
                    I had graduated from year 12 VCE last year and now studying online with open universities on introduction to Information Technology at RMIT. My hobbies are game that include strategy and card games, video games, puzzles, drawing, reading, lawn bowl, DJ which I do psycodelic and  psycodelic trans or other stuff that interest me and I have a dog called jojo </p>
                <p>My stats, i guess that form the results of the type ENFJ-T which is called turbulent protagonist from the Myer Brigg 16 personality test ( mar 7, 2022) are 57% extroverted and 43% introverted , 74% intuitive and 26% observant, 29% thinking and 71% feeling, 61% judging and 39% prospecting I think that ,  44% assertive and 56% turbulent, Although this was apparently not that far off from what’s my  personality in how I would like help people in settling conflicts and to find the answer to the given situation without attempting to be harmful or to disheartened other people  while taking their feeling into consideration and to understand where they are coming from. I would look at from both sides of a situation to get to a decision and would look at it from how other people might feel about the situation which I would think that this is represented by the results for 29% thinking and 71% feeling, 61% judging and 39% prospecting cause these are two similar characteristics when comparing them in how I feel mean that I apply more emotion then thinking  in a situation, however apparently I judge more which I guess judging could be interpretated as categorizing and analysing the parts of a situation to make a decision then i go into something on a feeling to get more of a return, although they are the opposite side of each other. This could be applied to the results for five big personality test (mar 23. 2022) that is openness to experience is a medium which means that I am more willing to find new experiences and to be enthralled in them which can be the little bit more extroverted that I’m still shocked about and I am intrigued to learn about people or stuff that interest me which is broad and i can figure out various of solution for a problem cause I am more open to new possibilities agreeableness is medium meaning that I am more likely to agree to the  group suggestion or  what’s in the meetings if need be and I attempt to avoid  making conflict meaning that I am more inclined to be comforting and kind, cooperating in group tasks. my extraversion is medium this means that I get more motivated when I work in a group setting and when the team members enthusiastic and dedicated to their work cause it’s a working environment. Although apparently these are the ones that didn’t get there on accuracy are conscientious and neuroticism cause I have anxiety which lead me to overthink that happen when I completing a task that’s assigned to me and when typing an email to someone or communicating to someone cause if I don’t say it right I might not my point across or offend someone, although I have good impulse control and thoughtfulness to other people.</p>

                    My name is Kian Yuke Hill, I live in a beach side town in QLD. Where I work as a 
                    Teacher aide/ Kind of a IT apprentice of sorts. From a very young age I have been addicted to technology 
                    whether that be the latest gaming system or even the old first gen ipods! My interest peaked when I realised I 
                    could utilise technology to help most people. I’m currently in the early stages of 
                    learning to upgrade a student data system in a government school. And on the side, I’m am still very 
                    addicted and fascinated in the world of video-games. I enjoy the thought of making a creative space where 
                    others can truly express their most artistic and creative selves. I’m 23 and only just realising this 
                    passion one day at a time. I can’t wait to work in a team that focuses more on the enjoyment 
                    of the industry and less on the money.</p>
