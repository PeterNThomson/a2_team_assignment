            <p>Peter <br> The highlight of this assignment for me was meeting a 
                group of awesome, like-minded guys who are as passionate as I am 
                for the IT industry. An improvement moving forward with the rest 
                of the course, in my eyes, would be our usage of Microsoft Teams. 
                I feel like portions of our meetings weren't really achieving a 
                whole lot and I think going into future meetings having a more 
                clearly defined agenda, and better recording of actions discussed 
                would help us keep the meetings to a more reasonable time limit as 
                a couple of them were a little drawn out. While I wouldn't say 
                that it was necessarily surprising, but more just interesting, 
                was hearing/reading about the groups different backgrounds and 
                what drove them to seek a career in the IT industry, particularly 
                given that we all had fairly similar job title goals in mind, yet 
                for vastly different companies. As someone who has been working in 
                a quite specific type of team environment for the better part of 15 
                years as a chef, something that become clear to me through this 
                assignment was the difference in pacing. Working in a more relaxed 
                and thought driven scenario was a welcome change to the rush and 
                volume of a kitchen.</p>
