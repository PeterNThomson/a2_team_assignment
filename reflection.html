                My experience working with the other Procrastinators has been a blast. 
                The team environment is fun and relaxed while still encouraging us to get work done, 
                and my teammates are supportive and friendly. Most of us are accustomed to working independently, 
                so I was surprised by how easy it was to coordinate and complete tasks despite our lack of experience 
                working in a group setting.
                <br>
                One thing that could be improved is our communication in and outside meetings. 
                This issue probably stems from our habit of working alone and lack of reliance on others, 
                but this didn’t bother me personally. I felt confident that we would all complete our tasks and enjoyed 
                seeing the finished work popping up on our website like magic.
                <br><br>
                Working with a team as good as this one has opened my eyes to the unique experiences that being with 
                others can bring to the table. It’s great hearing everyone’s input on ideas and fascinating to learn 
                about each other as people. We’re only halfway through our journey, and it can only get better from here. 
                I imagine after everything is said and done, many of us will keep in touch and even become good friends.

            <p>Michael <br> For me, the highlight of assessment 2 was the amazing team of like-minded
                individuals I was able to work and continue my IT studies with, as there is a very happy
                and friendly flow between the group, not to mention the key aspects in which we are all
                perusing common goals! We are all so passionate about what we are doing which makes for
                an easy flowing work environment, along with a fun one. Many laughs were shared as well
                as a lot of help amongst one another, and personally I could not have been gifted with
                better teammates. Regarding where we could potentially improve, I believe Microsoft Teams
                would be a good starting point. We had many great meetings, however they were not essentially
                very "clear" in the sense of meeting agendas etc. Moving forward I believe this is an area we
                could and should work on. Currently working at a Pet Resort as an Animal Attendant, 
                in which I did reduce my shifts to pursue my IT journey, however these were increased due
                to the high volume of animals over Easter, along with being short staffed.
                In the future I wish to put 110% percent into this, as opposed to just 100%.
                You have not seen the last of us yet! "The Procrastinator's" will keep shining on! </p>
                
                
                
            
            <p>Peter <br> The highlight of this assignment for me was meeting a 
                group of awesome, like-minded guys who are as passionate as I am 
                for the IT industry. An improvement moving forward with the rest 
                of the course, in my eyes, would be our usage of Microsoft Teams. 
                I feel like portions of our meetings weren't really achieving a 
                whole lot and I think going into future meetings having a more 
                clearly defined agenda, and better recording of actions discussed 
                would help us keep the meetings to a more reasonable time limit as 
                a couple of them were a little drawn out. While I wouldn't say 
                that it was necessarily surprising, but more just interesting, 
                was hearing/reading about the groups different backgrounds and 
                what drove them to seek a career in the IT industry, particularly 
                given that we all had fairly similar job title goals in mind, yet 
                for vastly different companies. As someone who has been working in 
                a quite specific type of team environment for the better part of 15 
                years as a chef, something that become clear to me through this 
                assignment was the difference in pacing. Working in a more relaxed 
                and thought driven scenario was a welcome change to the rush and 
                volume of a kitchen.</p>
